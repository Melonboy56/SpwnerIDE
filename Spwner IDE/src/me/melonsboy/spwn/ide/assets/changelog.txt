This is alpha version v1.1, By Melonsboy

New features:
 - Added compile configurations
 - Added a compiler downloader
 - Added window state saving
 - Recreated settings dialog
 - Added Themes
 - Added Tab Icons
 - Added Plugin support
 - Added Native Launcher for Windows, MacOS and Linux!

Also thanks for JetBrains for making some icons that are used in this program!

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed a bug where any project becomes unopenable when any project folder doesn't exist

I got some plans for Spwner IDE in the future and they are:
 - Add a geometry dash player built into Spwner IDE (so you can test your code without opening GD) <- this feature would be cool xD
 - Re add project file viewer (so a tree view instead of a single folder view)
 - Maybe add hot reload for integrated GD player?
 - Add a package manager (downloads packages from pckp.spwn.it website)

and this is alpha 1.1 of this IDE (build 2)
